# Comparison-of-various-ML-Classifiers-in-credit-risk-analysis

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning pipeline to predict credit risk using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model, combined with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance. The solution is benchmarked against other popular classifiers such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Develop an end-to-end credit risk prediction system
- Handle imbalanced datasets using SMOTE
- Compare multiple classification algorithms
- Evaluate models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC
- Visualize model performance using Power BI and Python libraries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Programming Language
- Python 3.8+

### IDE
- Google Colab (with optional Jupyter support)

### Machine Learning Libraries
- LightGBM
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- XGBoost
- Random Forest

### Data Visualization

### Version Control and Collaboration
- Git
- GitHub

## 📊 Visualizations

Final analysis visualizations are created using:
- Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI dashboards for business-oriented insights
