# Credit Risk Analysis using LightGBM and SMOTE

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning pipeline to predict credit risk using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model, combined with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance. The solution is benchmarked against other popular classifiers such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Develop an end-to-end credit risk prediction system
- Handle imbalanced datasets using SMOTE
- Compare multiple classification algorithms
- Evaluate models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC
- Visualize model performance using Power BI and Python libraries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Programming Language
- Python 3.8+

### IDE
- Google Colab (with optional Jupyter support)

### Machine Learning Libraries
